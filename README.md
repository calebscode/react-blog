# React Blog

A small React project I made to brush up on the basics.

## Functionality
- Read, create, delete, blogs from a database

## How to run
1. Clone this repo
2. run `npm i` (must have node, npm, npx installed)
3. To start the front-end, run `npm run start`
4. To start the mock database, in a separate terminal run `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`
5. Go to the urls provided after running the above commands and play around. You can see the data updated in `data/db.json` in real time while making changes.
